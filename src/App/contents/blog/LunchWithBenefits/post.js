          Small things can make a big difference when it comes to company culture
          and that’s something we at Wunderdog have learned by experience.

    <Chapter>
      <p>
        Wunderdog started as a small tech start-up in the Nordics with only the
        Founding Five onboard. Five years later, we’ve grown to be an
        international company with offices in Berlin and Malmö in addition to
        Helsinki and more than 100 employees, all offices combined. When a small
        start-up grows rapidly in the number of employees, things change. No
        longer does the company consist of a dozen friends sitting around one or
        two tables. When there are more people, it’s inevitably more difficult
        to know everyone well. Getting to know colleagues at the other end of
        the office suddenly requires more effort and often gets avoided.
        Nevertheless, there are simple yet significant things that can be done
        to make sure a communal company culture is maintained even when the
        number of employees hits a critical limit.

      <h2>Matchmaking</h2>
      <p>
        Frequently organizing internal events, after works and yearly company
        trip are all important in fostering the culture. A more low key habit
        we’ve had since the very beginning is a once-a-month lunch with a
        varying colleague — paid by the company. We’ve grown to be so many that
        it’s hard to make sure you have had lunch with everyone. That’s why,
        some time ago we introduced Donut the bot, who randomly connects you on
        Slack with another employee and suggests a lunch that week. Donut also
        remembers to ask you after a while whether you had the time to grab
        lunch together.

        And particularly, you learn to appreciate the variety of different
        personalities who you spend most of your daytime weekly working towards
        common goals, developing a deeper sense of belongingness.

      <p>
        Such small an effort as having lunch with a colleague you might not
        normally go with can have many benefits. Dedicating the lunch break to
        chat with a colleague outside of the office is a great way to get to
        know the other in a more relaxed environment. Fruitful conversations
        about work or life in general are often generated and they sometimes
        lead to new ideas and projects getting kicked off. Talking with someone
        who works in a very different position to yours teaches you about their
        work and the whole company. A problem you’ve had might get a fresh point
        of view and get solved over lunch when discussed with someone who has
        another approach to it. And particularly, you learn to appreciate the
        variety of different personalities who you spend most of your daytime
        weekly working towards common goals, developing a deeper sense of
        belongingness. This little habit has prompted interesting conversations,
        new initiatives and is surely one of the many ingredients that create
        the culture we have.

      <h2>Community before individuals</h2>
      <p>
        Wunderdog was once founded on a thought to create a workplace where
        employees are happy to come every day. Little after Wunderdog was
        founded, we created our culture manifesto together which states the
        core values that we as a company live up to every day. Community,
        teamwork and shared learning are essential. As we put it, the community
        comes before individuals. There are no incentives for internal competition,
        and for example, our bonus model is equal to everyone, regardless of the
        position, since we believe that everyone’s efforts contribute to our
        success.

        Communal culture comes from the feeling of belongingness. Knowing the
        person next to you — or at the other end of the office — is fundamental.
        Moreover, it builds trust and creates a safe environment to express
        ideas and give feedback. We care about the people we work with and
        appreciate the range of diverse personalities we have managed to gather
        under the same roof. Getting to know everyone is both important and
        intriguing.
