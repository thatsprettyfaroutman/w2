      <p>
        Last spring, Wunderdog’s equality and non-discrimination plan was
        updated along with our salary statistics, which generated an internal
        conversation about salaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        People were curious to know more about why there is a difference in
        salaries. We thought that this topic was important and started to dig
        into it more thoroughly, quickly reaching the conclusion that the best
        solution was to have an impartial outsider undertake a salary audit for
        us and help revise our non-discrimination plan.

        People Operations took ownership of this task and contacted Tasa-arvo.fi
        to ask if they could assist us in this matter. The personnel at the
        Tasa-arvo.fi seemed puzzled; why would a company contact them rather
        than an individual? Unfortunately, Tasa-arvo.fi can only help
        individuals and couldn’t assist us, but they did congratulate us on
        taking action on the issue as a company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we contacted the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
        Once again, the reply was confused. Why is a company, especially a
        private one, contacting them on such a matter? After a short discussion,
        it became clear that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
        was also unable to help companies with this matter – although they too
        were thrilled about us making the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tasa-arvo.fi and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration both
        suggested that we contact the World of Management (WoM), who might be
        able to help. WoM is one of only a handful of equality consultancies in
        Finland and is staffed with top-notch equality professionals. Their
        customers are mainly companies within the public sector; they rarely
        get contacted by private companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, we made yet another phone call. WoM, like the organizations before
        them, were baffled. Nevertheless, they agreed to help us, even though
        they had never carried out this kind of salary audit before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of the audit was to ensure that our equality plan was written
        according to legislation and that there are no unacceptable salary
        differences between colleagues.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The content of the equality plan was found to be accurate and
          valid.</li>
          <li>Current salary levels are acceptable when considering the nature
          of Wunderdog’s business.</li>
          <li>Differences between salaries were in line with equality law and
          Wunderdog’s salary rationale.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wunderdog could create a more extensive model for determining
          an individual’s skill and competence levels. For example, the breadth
          and depth of skills, as well as how they reflect on colleagues and
          Wunderdog as a company, could be described with statements.</li>
          <li>Wunderdog could develop a system for collecting feedback to
          ensure enough data is available to fairly assess the performance of
          employees.</li>
          <li>Wunderdog should continue to follow the equality plan and update
          it continuously as well as discuss the salary audit results with
          personnel.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The audit was carried out by equality consultant Sinikka Mustakallio
        and equality specialist Inkeri Tanhua from WoM Oy. Meri-Tuuli Olkkonen
        and Ville Komulainen from Wunderdog also worked on the project.
