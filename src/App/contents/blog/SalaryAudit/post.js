        Last spring the equality and non-discrimination plan of Wunderdog was
        updated along with the salary statistics which generated a conversation
        about salaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        People were curious to know more of the reasoning behind the differences
        in salaries. We at Wunderdog thought that this topic is an important one
        and started to dig into it more thoroughly. We thought the best solution
        was to have an impartial outsider to do a salary audit for Wunderdog and
        to revise the non-discrimination plan.

        People Operations took this task as their own and contacted Tasa-arvo.fi
        to ask whether they could assist us in this matter. The personnel at the
        Tasa-arvo.fi seemed a little puzzled, why would a company contact them
        rather than an individual person? Unfortunately for us, Tasa-arvo.fi is
        only able to help individuals and therefore could not assist on this
        matter, but they did congratulate us on taking actions as a company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next up, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration received a
        similar phone call. Once again the reply was at first confused, why is a
        company, especially a private one, contacting them on such a matter? And
        after a short discussion, it was soon clear that the Occupational Safety
        and Health Administration was thrilled about the reason for the call but
        unable to help companies with this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tasa-arvo.fi and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration both
        suggested that the World of Management, WoM in short, might be able to
        help. WoM is one of the rare equality consultancies in Finland. Their
        personnel are all top-notch equality experts. Their customers are mainly
        companies within the public sector, they rarely get contacted by private
        companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so it was time to make another phone call. WoM’s reaction, as
        everyone else's so far, was baffled. Nevertheless, the people at WoM
        said they might be able to help us, though they had never done this kind
        of salary audit before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of the salary audit was to ensure that the equality plan was
        made according to legislation and that there were no unacceptable salary
        differences between colleagues.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The content of the equality plan was assessed to be precise and
          valid.</li>
          <li>The grounds for salaries are acceptable when considering the
          nature of Wunderdog’s business.</li>
          <li>Differences between salaries were in line with the equality law
          and Wunderdog’s salary grounds.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wunderdog could create a more extensive model for determining an
          individual’s skill and competence levels.</li>
          <li>Skill areas: the width and depth of skills, as well as how they
          reflect on colleagues and Wunderdog as a company could be described
          with statements.</li>
          <li>Wunderdog could develop a system for collecting feedback to ensure
          enough data is available to fairly assess the performance of employees. </li>
          <li>Wunderdog continues to follow the equality plan and update it
          continuously as well as discuss the salary audit results with
          personnel.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The audit was made by equality consultant Sinikka Mustakallio and
        equality specialist Inkeri Tanhua from WoM Oy. Meri-Tuuli Olkkonen and
        Ville Komulainen participated in the salary audit from Wunderdog.
