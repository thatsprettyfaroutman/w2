      <h2>Part 3: When is a Design Sprint not a good option?</h2>
      <p>
        Even though the Design Sprint approach is versatile and suitable for
        many things, there are also situations where other methods will yield
        better results. These are some examples:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. The idea, product, service or operating model functions well and creates sales</b> <br/>
        TYou have a concept that has already been validated, a product that
        sells well or a well-established operating model that works. There’s no
        need to question everything or re-think the mode of operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. The subject area is too narrowly or strictly definied</b> <br/>
        If the question has been framed too narrowly or you hope to create a
        prototype of an idea without challenging it, Design Sprint is not a
        suitable approach. Pantone can use more traditional approaches to find
        next year’s colours, and beverage manufacturers will find it easier to
        use test samples and new packages to test new beverages, and for an
        online store a traditional A/B testing is the process to test whether
        green of blue “shop now” button drives better conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Your organisation just wants to cut product development costs </b> <br/>
        The purpose of a Design Sprint is not really to offer a cheaper
        alternative to carrying out extensive product development or user
        research. When the challenge is about developing an already existing
        product further, it’s easy to set your expectations too high. In these
        cases, it’s especially important to talk with stakeholders about what
        your approach is best suited for.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is most likely the case when you are trying to find a new direction
        for a product or a business model, or something new is sought for a
        specific product such as new user groups, channels or payment methods.
        Of course, the border between product development and product reform is
        vague at best, and sometimes it’s possible to apply the sprint approach
        to, for example, validating potential new features for your product.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Your company has no will or cpacity to change direction</b> <br/>
        It’s not uncommon that an organization has passionate discussions about
        reform, but in practice, there is too much resistance to change or
        resources are simply insufficient. This is natural. The best thing to do
        is usually admitting the fact that you’re not ready yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        As usual, there are exceptions: if the environment is resistant to
        change, the objective of the Design Sprint can be set in an alternative
        future. This may provide new perspectives and offer a good basis for
        discussing future prospects. You won’t need to implement everything at
        once. A Sprint can offer a quick dip into agile development: it can
        provide a framework that enables a traditional company to learn new
        methods. If, after a few years, the time comes for the results to be put
        to practice, you should review the new operating environment and consider
        carrying out another sprint.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Design Sprint is not the best way to move forward, you can
        usually continue product development through more familiar and
        traditional methods. Wunderdog is a software development company and,
        we are happy to help you with developing established products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any ideas you have about moving forward, we’d love to give you an honest
        opinion. Let’s talk!
      </p>
      <p>
        One meeting is usually enough for our digital service and service design
        experts to find out the best way for you to move forward.
