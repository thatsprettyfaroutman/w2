        Does this sound familiar? A company X has a software product. Over the course of 24 months, the product team
        worked on a bunch of new and updated features with external consultants and agencies. The project had the right
        stakeholders within the organisation, all with specific needs for various essential features. The project team
        worked hard to design and build all those features to satisfy the needs of the stakeholders. At the same time,
        the business functions generated multiple powerpoints of the future success of the updated offering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the product team succeeded in jumping through all the loops necessary to finish the project. The
        development budget was close to a million euros covering the design and coding of the product upgrade. The team
        finished on time and budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        The launch of the updated product was a success, right? The product became better! All the features were built
        based on requirements from stakeholders.
      </p>
      <BlockQuote>"Although the product became better, it didn’t help the business become better."</BlockQuote>
      <h2>Endgame</h2>
      <p>
        In the end, the update didn’t help the company to do more of what they wanted to accomplish. It didn’t help to
        generate more paying customers. It didn’t help existing customers to become happier nor did it reduce the cost
        of customer success. Although the product became better, it didn’t help the business become better.
      </p>
      <h2>Re-thinking Product Vision</h2>
      <p>
        This is a reality in many organisations building software products. The process is universal, and it happens
        across industries. Lots of time and money is poured in the quest to become better, but all too often this
        doesn’t translate into tangible business success for the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        In building better products, it is imperative first to understand what better means. In product development,
        better product means figuring out what customers need and giving it to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, all your product development decisions should revolve around the customer. Not your internal
        stakeholders. Obsess about making your customers successful and don’t hesitate to say no to anything that will
        not drive better customer outcome.
      </p>
      <h2>Customer is The Center of Your Product Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Once you’ve figured out what is the outcome your customers want to be improved, and you have decided to pursue
        the opportunity, the next step is to align all the stakeholders to aim for a common shared goal. We like to call
        the common goal a North Star Metric. North Star Metric is a widely used concept by the most successful product
        companies, such as Airbnb, Uber and the likes. It helps teams to organise all activities to focus on a common
        shared goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The North Star Metric should be the single metric that best captures the core value that your product delivers
        to your customers. Optimising all your efforts towards this metric is the key in driving your product strategy
        into success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time you have a meeting with any of the stakeholders, ask if their requests help you to reach the North
        Star faster. If so, do they have well-grounded arguments for prioritising their features? Have the potential
        impacts been validated?
      </p>
      <p>All in all, setting a common shared goal is your first step to execute a successful product strategy.</p>
