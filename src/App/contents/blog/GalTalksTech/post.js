      <h2>In a Nutshell: Tell us a bit about your job and what role technology plays in it?</h2>
      <p>
        I work for Wunderdog, a software development and design agency from
        Finland with offices in Berlin, Helsinki and Malmö. I am Germany’s
        Country Lead. My job is very diverse; I oversee strategic decisions,
        operations and budget related issues. I advise clients on different
        suitable solutions for their needs. I am a lawyer by training, so I
        also oversee legal matters at Wunderdog, especially in relation to data
        protection, compliance and contracts. One of my responsibilities is to
        enable a sustainable environment, thus I work closely with the teams to
        make sure they get support and training.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tech plays a big role in my everyday life. I would say the most important
        thing is to have a general understanding of what you can do with
        different technologies and tools. That’s why I keep myself updated with
        the new changes, discourses and happenings related to tech.

      <h2>Where did your professional journey start and how did you get to
        where you are now?</h2>
      <p>
        I have always had a great interest in different cultures. I also love
        meeting new people, I find that to be the best way to broaden one’s own
        mindset. During my studies I had several internships abroad, for example
        in the U.S. (Detroit), Czech Republic (the Finnish embassy), Luxembourg
        (Court of Justice of the EU) and Germany. My studies also took me to
        Zanzibar (a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania), where I studied human
        rights, international law and Islamic law for half a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time came to start my MA in law, I decided to focus on tech and
        intellectual property law. I saw this field was a powerful path to have
        an impact on things, also at a human rights level: you have to make
        changes from within. After graduation, I was offered a job as general
        counsel for Wunderdog, where I paved the path to becoming the company’s
        country lead in Germany. Two years later I moved to Berlin for that
        purpose and I set up the operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding how I got to where I am today, it was a mix between very hard
        work, a stream of lucky coincidences and thinking ahead to make good
        choices. I think staying curious and being open to explore new
        opportunities were crucial as well.

      <h2>What is the greatest transformation in technology you’ve witnessed in your career?</h2>
      <p>
        Our generation went from analog to digital, and this is a hard spot to
        be in a way because you basically know two different worlds. Our elders
        have trouble understanding the new digital reality and digital natives
        coming after us do not relate to our previous analog world. My
        generation is caught in between both and it’s not always easy to find
        your place and set boundaries.

        “Deep learning and big data have also had an enormous effect on society;
        issues such as data rights and privacy are the new big struggles of our
        time.”
    </BlockQuote>
      <p>
        Having said that, for me, the biggest transformation has been the
        hegemony of tech itself. Big societal changes have always been linked to
        technology, and the current trends in AI, machine learning, etc. reflect
        the moment we are currently in. Social media has also been an important
        change; it has completely flipped our ways of living in the world, of
        relating to each other and to ourselves. Deep learning and big data have
        also had an enormous effect on society; issues such as data rights and
        privacy are the new big struggles of our time. We can see it just by
        understanding the value of data, which is now surpassing the value of
        oil. As a lawyer, I find these issues particularly interesting to follow.
      </p>
      <h2>What are two of the biggest challenges that women who want to venture
        in the world of technology face today?</h2>
      <p>
        The world of technology is still very male-dominated. This is the main
        fact. It’s hard to pose two challenges only because this is very
        contingent on your job position, country, privilege status, ethnic
        roots, etc. Mine is being a woman in tech without a tech background,
        because you have to constantly prove yourself. If you don’t have a title
        that specifies that you possess knowledge on the matter, there will
        always be pressure to prove your knowledge to others and yourself. As a
        woman, especially in a leadership position, you have to assert your
        value almost constantly. This is even more difficult in a field where
        the female presence is scarce (although this is slowly changing), and
        more so if on top of that you have to prove that you are knowledgeable
        about tech without a certificate that cannot be contested.
      </p>
      <p>
        For women venturing into tech, I’d say: network! Connect with other
        women and get support from them. Learn from them. Women networks are a
        great source of inspiration and can help you grow both professionally
        and as a person.

      <h2>What skills do you need for a career in tech (aside from the actual tech skills)?</h2>
      <p>
        Although tech skills are useful, they are not always necessary in all
        job positions in tech. Tech operates at various levels and every tech
        company needs a diverse pool of employees with different knowledge,
        assets and abilities. Something that has proved to be very positive is
        transdisciplinarity: people with different backgrounds (in tech and non
        tech) working together to reach common goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having an interest in understanding tech can also get you very far.
        Knowing what you can do with technology and how to use it is even more
        important. Most of the jobs that will be demanded in the future don’t
        even exist yet. For example, those related to ethics of certain
        technologies, such as AI or machine learning. Soft skills are also
        proving to be increasingly relevant in the field. Thus I’d say constant
        learning is a must. Keeping yourself updated and staying curious will
        probably end up being your biggest asset.
      </p>
      <h2>When you think about ‘women’ and ‘technology’ what comes to your mind first?</h2>
      <p>
        I see possibilities. It’s fascinating to witness how women are fighting
        to take tech back to their domain, as they did in the 80s. Communities
        and groups are rising. This is very visible in Berlin, which is a very
        community-based society. There are plenty of meetups and groups where
        women get together, share their knowledge and teach each other.

      <p>
        Regarding future generations, we need to stop gendering tech. The ways
        we raise our children will have an unquestionable effect on our future
        societies, and actions need to be taken. I am from Finland, a country
        where coding is already being taught at school. I think giving more
        access, mentoring and encouraging girls to play with technology will
        have a very big and positive effect on tech in the future. Tech knowledge
        enables a broader understanding of the world and it’s currently one of
        the best tools to make societal changes.
      </p>
      <h2>What and who were the influencers of who you are today?</h2>
      <p>
        As cliché as it might sound, friends and family have been the main
        influencers of who I am today. Your environment shapes you and the way
        you think; the more people you meet and interact with, the broader
        perception of things you get. The communities and networks I’ve been
        part of throughout my career path have also been crucial. From the
        people that I’ve worked with to my mentors, the conferences and talks
        I’ve attended, the Berlin Meetup scene, etc. All of them have had a
        profound effect on my professional development. I prefer face-to-face
        interaction over social media; I still think it’s the best way to get
        to know a person. I use online networks mainly as a medium to connect
        with other people in real life.
      </p>
      <h2>If you could host a dinner party with 3 influential people in tech, who would you invite and why?</h2>
      <p>
        It’s a common place, but it would be incredibly interesting to invite
        Sheryl Sandberg. It would make sense to invite someone with that much
        power and influence to talk to and get answers. I’d like to know how she
        copes with her power position, but also with the gender aspect, the
        pressure and the life-work balance. There are also many critical
        reflections that would be fascinating to share with her, ranging from
        moral and ethical questions to her leadership culture or insight on the
        current global state of affairs. Her work has had a profound effect on
        society in many levels. A lot has been written about her, but much of it
        probably nobody else but her can answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d also invite Sophia Amoruso, founder of Nasty Gal and Girlboss, a
        fascinating character. She exemplifies very well what can happen in
        business when decisions are not properly made. She managed to build an
        empire with everything against her: no formal education, no business
        knowledge, being female and being very young. It seems it was too much
        for her and she filed for bankruptcy due to mismanagement a few years
        later, which is another side of the story that we usually forget.
        Amoruso is relatable: she had no place in business but she happened to
        be at the right place doing the right thing at the right time. And, in
        the end, a big part of our success is also a product of luck mixed with
        hard work and taking risks. She would be a great counterpart to Sandberg,
        who is almost the product of a corporate manual, and has played much
        safer than Amoruso.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third wheel would be someone local, Berlin-based, that represents
        the community that we are based on. I thought of Lubomila Jordanova,
        because her work is extremely important. She is the founder of Plan A,
        the first data-driven action platform in the fight against climate
        change. In one interview I read recently, Jordanova was asked what
        technical skills she picked in previous roles that she applied to her
        startup, and she answered: “Excel, Powerpoint and writing emails”, which
        I find very cool. Usually we don’t see how a lot of the important work
        in impactful businesses starts at a ground level, with small things.
