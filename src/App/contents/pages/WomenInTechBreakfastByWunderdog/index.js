          About the event
        </h2>
      <p>For this session, we have gathered our insights on the dos and don'ts of
      working remotely. We will discuss practical examples for you to take with
      you to your own working environment. We'll introduce the theory frame of
      basic psychological needs and discuss how sustainable remote work
      practices can be built keeping those in mind. In addition to our
      presentation, we hope the event works as a platform for discussion and
      sharing useful insights for the participants to take into practice.
      </p>
      <p>The session will be hosted by Wunderdog's Head of People Operations,
      Emilia Vesa and Wunderdog GmbH COO Joanna Rindell.
