      <h4>The inevitable challenge</h4>
      <p>
        Yle, the Finlandâ€™s national public broadcaster, needed to rethink their
        content to engage with the viewers and to bridge the gap between TV and
        the audience. The challenge was to create content for younger audience
        and making TV broadcast more immersive.

      <h4>Our addictive solution</h4>
      <p>
        The solution is an easy and fast game that would captivate the
        players. The idea itself is simple, but the challenge was in creating
        it in an attractive way to engage players. At the same time, we needed
        to keep in mind that the potential audience was huge, and the game would
        also be played in live studios, so there was no room for bugs
        development-wise
      </p>
      <p>
        We started the design and development from scratch and created
        Pumpumhiihto, a game where the player needs to ski as fast as possible
        to the shooting ranges.
      </p>
      <p>
        The essence of the game lays in its addictive idea and beautiful design.
