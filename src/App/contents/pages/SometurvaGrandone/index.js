      Sometimes when I opened Facebook the first 7 posts on my front page
      were posts where people were slagging me off.

      <h2>How SomeBuddy works</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Most of the social media crimes are complainant offences, that
        can be dealt with settling.</b> <br/> From a request SomeBuddy can send
        a settling request for the person who commited the crime to allow the
        settling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Occasionally, crimes committed on social media canâ€™t be settled,
        like sex offends.</b> <br/> In these cases SomeBuddy contacts
        the victim and advises them in detail on how to proceed with the
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>SomeBuddy helps with reporting the crime to parents.</b> <br/>
        Victims might often feel ashamed or guilty, which stops them from
        asking help from their parents. SomeBuddy helps by creating a
        personalized letter to parents. The letter tells what
        the victim has suffered from and how to proceed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If the case does not fill the characteristics of a crime,
        they are still provided emotional support, suggestions how to
        proceed with the case and tips for social media security settings.</b> <br/>
        In every case, SomeBuddy is there to support the youngster.
        Psychological help is available through the service.
